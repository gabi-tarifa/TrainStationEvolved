## TrainStation Evolved
For everyone who found my github, welcome y'all!!

- You'll be able to send a train for multiple jobs destinations, don’t matter if the train was already send to other job or not. However, the time remaining will be added (or substituted) to the new time travel;
- You won’t build a cargo and a passenger train from the same locomotive, and neither the cargo or passenger train will collect and deliver the resources at the same time. However you may use the same train, scheduling it to send the resources right after it collected them all;
- There will be factories at the station that enable some materials, that wouldn’t be obtained via cargo trains, to be collected, delivered for contract jobs, or used for other materials production;
